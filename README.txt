== Description ==

WooCommerce Review Collector Plugin is all about collecting reviews and ratings from online customers. So, if you own a Woocommerce site and you need to collect customer reviews for your products, it’s time for you to install this plugin. WooCommerce Review Collector Plugin features a simple review platform with an option of star-ratings and an additional space to write reviews – all embedded in an email and sent to the customer who purchased a product from your WooCommerce site.

Online reviews are probably one of the best sources of new business for any ecommerce owner. A good review embraces customer experience and gives an ecommerce owner the exact insight of where his products stand in the global arena of online marketplaces.

**How is WooCommerce Review Collector Plugin different?**
A lot of ecommerce sites take the help of review collection portal to collect online customer reviews for them. The store owners pay these sites for managing review services. However, their plugins need API to store review information; and whenever that API is updated, or the plugin is deactivated or replaced with another plugin, the previous reviews are lost – along with the money you spent on them.
WooCommerce Review Collector Plugin on the other hand, stores all the review information as Woocommerce Default Review. As a result, it does not control or manage these reviews through an API.

**Benefits of WooCommerce Review Collector Plugin to WooCommerce Owners:**
Collecting organic and authentic customer reviews and publishing them on ecommerce sites can go a long way in establishing credibility for an ecommerce site. Genuine reviews are what builds trust both between the existing customers and the ecommerce sight; and between ecommerce sites and its prospective customers.
Several review sites have grown exponentially over the last couple of years. But still, there is no way of telling authentic reviews from fake ones. Often people are paid to write reviews of products to boost sales. It is not only illegitimate, but also misleading. This is particularly harmful for customers, because they don’t know who to trust. And as an ecommerce owner, you lose your credibility in front of your target audience because of these fake reviews.
WooCommerce Review Collector Plugin lets you do away with all these apprehensions. Since this plugin only asks for a review from genuine customers, who have actually purchased the product, there is no room for fabrication or delusion. Customers can review their experience about the product and it’s all in good faith.
